      <p id="content1par">
        When we left our desks back in March, we didn’t think twice about leaving our office plants and <br> 
        reading glasses behind.Days became weeks, weeks stretched to months. (We eventually said <br>
        goodbye to the fiddle leaf figs). Soon we were sharing tips on how to work together while apart...
        <!-- , and recognizing a fundamental shift in the way we work. -->
        <!-- The resiliency of our Google colleagues was never in doubt, but this year we saw them flex and adapt in exciting new directions, -->
        <!--all while meeting people where they are (usually at home), to deliver experiences that made us feel more connected, informed, and optimistic than ever. -->
        <!-- Most of the work we reviewed for this year’s annual revue was created remotely, during a global pandemic, and is shaped by that context. -->
        <!--And yet, we think you’ll find that the noteworthy projects—including crowdsourced earthquake alerts and variable fonts—add up to a stellar year for UX at Google. -->
        <!-- As we look ahead to 2021 (praise be!) take a minute to applaud the work and the people who made 2020 sing. -->
